### Git Config (one time initial setup)

```git config --global user.name "Jimi Jamison"```

```git config --global user.email "myemail@gmail.com"```

### Using Forks

Navigate to https://github.com/tharper/slcc_HTML.  Fork this repo using the fork button in the upper right-hand corner of the page. 

Clone your forked repo to you local machine using terminal / command line.

If a directory does not exist with your name, create a new directory to store your completed assignments.  The new directory should be titled your name. Example:  firstNameLastName
